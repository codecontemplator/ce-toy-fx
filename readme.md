# About this repo

ce-toy-fx is the continuation of [ce-toy-cs](https://github.com/codecontemplator/ce-toy-cs) and [ce-toy](https://github.com/codecontemplator/ce-toy).

# Ideas

* Improve logging
* Support dynamic rules 
* Can expression tree key analysis be less of a hack?
* Chaining of rejection policies (negative srules) are not intuitive
* Lift is a natural transformation. Based on this observation; separate lift into different concerns and refactor.
